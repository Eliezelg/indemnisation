      {
        "question": "Am I entitled to compensation?",
        "answer": "You are entitled to compensation if your flight was delayed by more than 3 hours, cancelled or if you were denied boarding. Flights departing from or arriving in the EU are covered by EC Regulation 261/2004. Flights from/to Israel are covered by the Israeli Aviation Services Law of 2012."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much can I receive?",
        "answer": "The amount depends on the flight distance: • Less than 1500 km: €250 (EU) or ₪1490 (Israel) • 1500-3500 km: €400 (EU) or ₪2390 (Israel) • More than 3500 km: €600 (EU) or ₪3580 (Israel). We automatically calculate the optimal amount for your situation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the process take?",
        "answer": "On average, the process takes between 4 to 8 weeks once your file is complete. We handle all communications with the airline and keep you informed at every step."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents do I need to provide?",
        "answer": "You will need: • Boarding pass (mandatory) • Booking confirmation • ID or passport • Proof of delay/cancellation (if available). You can upload these documents directly from your personal space."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if my claim fails?",
        "answer": "If we fail to obtain your compensation, you pay nothing. Our service works on a \"no win, no fee\" basis. You only pay our commission (25% incl. VAT) if we recover your compensation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a time limit to make a claim?",
        "answer": "Yes, you have up to 3 years after the flight date to make a claim under EC Regulation 261/2004, and up to 5 years under Israeli law. However, we recommend making your claim as soon as possible."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do extraordinary circumstances cancel my right?",
        "answer": "Airlines often invoke \"extraordinary circumstances\" (extreme weather, air traffic control strikes, etc.) to refuse compensation. Our team of legal experts examines each case to determine if this excuse is valid. In many cases, we manage to obtain compensation despite these arguments."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I claim for multiple passengers?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can create a claim for each passenger affected by the disruption. Each passenger is entitled to individual compensation. If you were traveling as a family, you can multiply the compensation amount by the number of passengers."
      },
      {
        "question": "How will I receive my compensation?",
        "answer": "Once the airline agrees to pay, we deduct our commission (25% incl. VAT) and transfer the remaining amount directly to your bank account. You typically receive payment within 7 to 14 days of the airline's agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I track the progress of my claim?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! You have a personal space where you can see the status of your claim in real-time, upload additional documents, and communicate with our team via integrated messaging. You also receive email notifications at each important step."
